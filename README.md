# Springboot Application
This repo is for deploying the spring boot application using docker and aws resources. Infra provisioning will be done using terraform

I forked the springboot application called petclinic from this repo: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic <br>
Application is renamed to petclinic. If you wanna know more about the app, visit the repo or read README inside that renamed petclinic directory
